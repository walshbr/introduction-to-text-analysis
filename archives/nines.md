# NINES and Digital Archives

Once a text is encoded in TEI, the work of a textual scholar has only begun. Encoding is the first step in a long process of preparing documents, historical or otherwise, for presentation and distribution on the web. Now that you have some sense of what it takes to begin thinking about putting a document online, let's think more about the stakes.

When you find a work encoded in TEI online, it might not be clearly apparent at first glance. You can find the TEI materials of _The Old Bailey Online_ by clicking "View as XML" at the bottom of a particular entry \(TEI is a version of XML, which is a more general [markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language)\). If you do so for [this entry](http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=t18881119-50&div=t18881119-50&terms=ripper#highlight) on a robbery case involving mention of Jack the Ripper, you can take a look at their TEI. It might not recognize a lot of the tags \(there are _loads_ of TEI tags\), but the general arrangement of them should look familiar:

Focus on what you do know: the tagging syntax, and where to go to look for help. A lot of working with technology consists of not panicking and then looking up what you don't know. But I digress.

When you look at the entry on the _Old Bailey Online_, almost all the tags disappear:

We have already talked a bit about the functions you can get from TEI, but, after all, those might not be enough to warrant the amount of work that goes into putting together a TEI-encoded text.

> What might be your intellectual reasons for encoding something in TEI if the user will never really interact with it as such?

One good reason might be to increase access to the materials. After all, a manuscript kept in a museum requires that someone go that museum in order to read the document. A digital version online can reach a wider audience than a physical copy. However, putting materials on the internet raises a variety of legal and financial issues. After all, these digital resources require a great deal of time, funding, and energy to produce.

> Will you make your materials freely available to anyone with an internet connection?&gt; Or will you require payment to see them?

If you have ever tried to access a resource from an online newspaper only to be told that you need to subscribe to see their content, you have encountered such **paywalled** materials. Resources like these can be juxtaposed with **open access** materials. While there are different levels and variants, open access broadly means that the materials are provided available with little to no restrictions. For many, the choice is an ethical and a political one. But open access materials do raise serious financial questions:

> Keeping materials online requires sustained funding over time. How can open access work be maintained if they are presented for free?

Once materials are put online, it is possible to connect them to a wider, global network of similar digital materials. In the same way that a library gathers information about the materials so that they may be organized in a systematic way \(more on **metadata** in our chapter on "Problems with Data"\), the process has to be overseen carefully in order for this networking to happen. Technical standards also shift \(TEI tags can change over time\), so archival materials require constant maintenance. If you have ever used a digital archive, you have taken advantage of a vast and often invisible amount of labor happening behind the scenes. The hidden work of gallery, library, archive, and museum \(or **GLAM**\) professionals ensures that our cultural heritage will remain accessible and sustainable for centuries to come.

The **Networked Infrastructure for Nineteenth-Century Electronic Scholarship ([NINES](https://www.nines.org))** is one such digital humanities organization that attempts to facilitate this process and gather archived materials pertaining to the Nineteenth Century. You might think of NINES as something like a one-stop shopping for all your nineteenth-century digital humanities and text analysis needs. It gathers together peer-reviewed projects on nineteenth-century literature and culture that were put together by different research teams around the globe; some focus on an individual author, others on a genre \(periodicals or "penny dreadfuls"\) or a particular issue \(disability or court cases\). If you go to the site and scroll through "Federated Websites," you'll see the range of projects you can get to from NINES, from one on the eighteenth-century book trade in France to another featuring the letters of Emily Dickinson. For the purposes of this class, you'll notice that some of the projects will be extremely useful to you, such as the Old Bailey Online, which contains trials records from London's central criminal court. Others, such as a project on the journals of Lewis and Clark, won't be relevant for this class -- but might be for others you are taking.

You might also notice that NINES has a relatively expansive view of what the nineteenth century is, since this site includes projects that deal with the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. Historians often talk of the "long nineteenth century" as the period from the beginning of the French Revolution in 1789 to the outbreak of World War I in 1914. In other words, historians of the nineteenth century like to claim big chunks of other people's time periods.

Archives submit themselves for affiliation with NINES so that their materials can be searchable alongside other NINES sites, but they must pass a rigorous process of **peer review** first. Academic journals rely on peer review to ensure that scholarship meets particular standards of rigor and relevance; you can think of it as a bit like quality control for scholarly writing. The peer review process typically involves submitting an article or book to a series of blind reviewers who, anonymous themselves, write letters in support or rejection of the project and offer suggestions for improvement. Should the piece pass, it moves onto publication and receives the explicit seal of approval from the publication.

**Why go through peer review?**

If you work on one of these projects, peer review sounds like a lot of work, but this actually works out well for you. For one, it's a way to get suggestions for improvement. Scholars also see peer-reviewed projects as being more prestigious than non-peer reviewed works and, for the purposes of promotion, they "count" more than non-peer reviewed works and peer review allows faculty members to assure their colleagues that their work is worthy of funding. Digital projects present unique complications to this process: they require reviewers who understand not only the content but also the technical aspects of a project. Digital projects also take an extraordinary amount of work and resources, so it makes sense that their contributors want credit for their work. Furthermore, it can be difficult to evaluate something like an archive, when a large part of our training focuses on the production and evaluation of essays. So, say you worked on *The Old Bailey Online* and are up for a promotion at your institution soon; submitting this project to NINES for peer review is a way to make sure that your colleagues recognize the hard work you put into this project.

One of the early missions of NINES was to provide scholars who could perform this service. By assembling digital humanities scholars that could evaluate digital archives and attest to their successes or flaws, project coordinators could better make their work available and understandable to non-digital colleagues.

The peer reviewers at NINES had several comments in their feedback for you. They wanted you to make changes before they would accept your project into NINES, but, good news! These comments make your work much stronger anyway, and you are happy to do them \(peer review doesn't always go so smoothly\). Once reviewed, NINES makes the archival materials available for searching alongside other peer-reviewed projects. You can see an example search of _The Old Bailey Online_ [here](http://www.nines.org/search?q=old%20bailey). Now that your archival materials are part of the archive, a search for 'old bailey' in NINES reveals objects not only in NINES, but also in a wide range of other archives.

**What does peer review mean for you as a user of an archive?**

If you've made it this far in life, you've probably realized that you can't trust everything you find on the internet. In this case, knowing that something is peer reviewed allows you to put more trust in what you find on NINES than what you find elsewhere; you know that other scholars in the field have signed off on this material and think it is worthy of inclusion.

**Why else should I use NINES?**

Beyond the fact that you can have a lot of confidence in the projects you find here, NINES is just going to make it easier for you to find things. For one, you might not have known about all these different projects. NINES has also made sure that these projects "play nice" with each other (a.k.a. interoperability), which means you can find references to a particular topic or word across these projects with a simple search.

![nines crime search](/assets/archives/nines-crime-search.jpg)

Doing a search for "crime" gets you all the references to this term in all of the different projects linked to NINES, saving you from having to search each individual one. \(One warning: only some of the results you get in the left pane will get you to material from the online projects affiliated with NINES. In other cases, NINES is searching library catalogs where the material is not available digitally. In this instance, if you wanted to read the first work, Alexandre Dumas's _Celebrated Crimes_, you would have to drive to Charlottesville and go to UVA's Special Collections Library.\)
