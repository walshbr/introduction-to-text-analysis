# Where to go Next

While writing this book, I used [GitBook's text editor](https://www.gitbook.com/editor/osx) so that I could preview the final product before it was published online. I found it really annoying to type while my text was screaming at me like this:

The most irritating thing was that I could not tell what metrics they were using to diagnose my writing. What makes a sentence difficult? The number of words in each sentence? The number of clauses? Subjects in particular positions? I have all sorts of opinions about why writing might be unclear, but, as best I could tell, the editor was mostly basing their suggestions on the number of words in each sentence. I turned the feature off and went on with my life, but not before noting a truism of working digital humanities: using a tool built by someone else forces you to abide by their own assumptions and conventions. 

You might have had similar feelings while reading this book. You have used a series of powerful tools in the course of working through this book, but tools have their limitations. While using *Prism*, for example, you might have wished that you could see an individual user's interpretations to compare it with the group's reading. Or when using *Voyant*, you might have wondered if you could analyze patterns in the use of particular parts of speech throughout a text.

A logical next step for you might be to learn a programming language that can help facilitate textual analysis. Python and R are two widely used languages for these applications with a [wealth of resources](resources.html) to help get you started. Exploring a new programming language takes time and dedication, but it can help guide you towards new types of questions that you might not otherwise be able to ask. Learning to program can help you determine what types of questions and projects are doable, and which ones might need to be let go. Most importantly, it can help you realize when using a tool someone else has built is better than reinventing the wheel.

This workbook by no means exhausts the topic of digital text analysis, but we hope that you have learned enough to get a sense of the possibilities that such methods can bring.
