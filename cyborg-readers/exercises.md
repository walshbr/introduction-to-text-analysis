How many tokens are in the following sentence? How many types?

'Speak!' cried Todd, 'speak! and speak the truth, or your last hour is come!

Upload the text for *The String of Pearls* available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmw9t/introduction-to-text-analysis/master/assets/the-string-of-pearls-full.txt) into *[Voyant](voyant-tools.org)*. Analyze the results. If things seem particularly slow, you can try working with a smaller chunk of the text.

* Use Voyant to examine gender in the text. What kind of words do you need to look at? Which parts of Voyant? Make some sort observations about your findings (3-5 sentences). Feel free to include a screenshot of the visualizations to help describe your observations.
* How would you measure moments of heightened suspense in the text? Take a spin at doing it if you think have a solid idea. Or simply theorize in 3-5 sentences.

Now upload the text for the various articles on *[Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper about The Hampstead Murders](http://vrchristensen.com/http:/vrchristensen.com/category/newspaper-articles/lloyds-weekly-newspaper/)* to Voyant and analyze them. Each of these texts attempts to build their worlds in different ways: one is an actual Victorian text, and one is pretending to be a historical text. 
* How does Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper try to create a sense of reality? How does it make you think "wait. is this historical fiction or a historical document?" You can use your own sense of reading the text, but try to find something in Voyant to back up those gut feelings. 3-5 sentences.
* What is one other thing that you find yourself interested in while reading this text? How might you measure it? (don't use Voyant - here you are just thinking about what might be possible). 3-5 sentences.
