# Exercises

* Take the following text, and mark it on [our class Prism:](http://prism.scholarslab.org/prisms/84f15902-686a-11e6-905c-005056b3784e/highlight?locale=en)

  > Anita Sarkeesian doesn’t give me the address of her San Francisco apartment over email. Instead, she texts it to me a few hours before we’re set to meet. After thousands of rape and death threats, a bomb scare and an email promising a mass shooting at one of her speaking events, a woman can’t be too careful. For some male gaming aficionados, the most frightening enemy isn’t an animated foe but this 31-year-old feminist with a penchant for hoop earrings, sitting across from me. They’ve called Sarkeesian a con artist, and raised thousands of dollars to film an exposé-style documentary about her \(which exposes nothing\). Some even created a game in which users can punch an image of her face until it is bloodied.


* Now take the same text and process it on the live demo for [Stanford's sentiment analysis software](http://nlp.stanford.edu:8080/sentiment/rntnDemo.html). \(Note that each sentence is it's own tree and that the demo color codes individual words as very negative, negative, neutral, positive or very positive\).

* What are the differences between how the emotions are marked in the Prism versus how they are marked in Stanford's tool?

* What does all this say about what humans are better at? Computers?
